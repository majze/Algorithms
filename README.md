# Algorithms
Example code for executing common computer algorithms.

## Source.cpp
Modify example code here before using the menu system. Runs well in visual studio (2015, 2017).

## common.cpp
Includes functions vital to mostly all the other files (such as PrintArray and Randomize) as well as the menu flavor text for each of the other cpp files.

## Sort.cpp
Includes simple sorting algorithms of Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Selection Sort.

## Search.cpp
Includes simple searching algorithms of Binary Search and Sequential Search.

## DivideConquer.cpp
Includes examples of Mergesort and QuickSort, two divide and conquer algorithms. The algorithms divide an input set into several subproblems of the same type and similar size. The subproblems are then solved either top-down, bottom-up, or recursively.
